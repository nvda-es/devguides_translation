"For many years, NV Access and the NVDA community have received hundreds of "
"pull requests from many contributors, including new features, bug fixes, and "
"translations. While many pull request discussion centered around "
"implementation, there were several that needed to be edited to make the new "
"code compliant with NVDA's coding guidelines."

"In 2019, as part of a broader effort to port NVDA to Python 3 and to ease "
"pull request review process, NV Access introduced linting tools, "
"specifically Flake8. Linting allows source code to be checked for coding "
"guidelines and gives a chance for contributors to correct mistakes before "
"submitting changes for review by the community."
