"Windows 7 and 8.1, Windows 10 is the first attempt from Microsoft at "
"connecting with users and taking comments seriously. Second, build 9841 (the "
"first Insider Preview build) hailed the start of Windows as a Service, a "
"completely different approach to upgrading Windows where Microsoft wanted to "
"provide two things: continuous delivery and feedback loop, and a unified "
"configuration that works well with most devices. There were setbacks, such "

"There is another, more personal reason for calling October 2014 release a "
"maiden flight: I became one of the first Windows Insiders, and due to my "
"work on NVDA, I have decided to make sure screen reader users were treated "
"with respect. This included sending accessibility-related feedback, getting "
"other screen reader users onboard as Insiders, and releasing NVDA try builds "
"that resolved important issues for Windows Insiders. This culminated in the "
"release of Windows 10 App Essentials add-on in November 2015 (in time for "
"Windows 10 Version 1511/build 10586 release) that provided basic support for "
"Insider Hub (now Feedback Hub) and other workarounds, which translated to "
"superb user experience for NVDA users when it comes to using Windows 10 and "
"various universal apps. My work on championing accessibility continues "

"* Use useful labels: in case the control has no label as reported by screen "
"readers, be sure to provide labels. A good historical case is Windows "
"Defender Security Center where there was no label for various buttons in "
"2016, which was fixed in 2017 with Creators Update. Also, avoid generic XAML "
"labels such as someclass.someotherclass.such (especialy lists and list "
"items), as it does not provide an accurate picture as to where one is "
"located. A classic case is Feedback Hub app where generic labels for lists "
"were presnet in older versions, subsequently fixed in recent updates."

"* Raise appropriate UIA events: screen readers listen to UIA events to "

"appeared, with recent versions raising this event."

"With the introduction of Windows 10 and Universal Windows Platform, a new "
"way of connecting users and developers has emerged: feedback-driven "
"development. This allows users to send feedback regarding features and bugs, "
"including that of accessibility feedback. Although accessibility of Windows "
"10 and universal apps were spotty at first, this situation is improving, "
"driven by Microsoft's commitment to accessibility, continued feedback, and "
"collaboration between Microsoft and assistive technology vendors."

"In terms of NVDA, what made Windows 10 usability possible was not only "
"changes made from within Windows and universal apps, but also proactive "
"investigations into making sure NVDA users have a great time with Windows "
"10. Windows 10 App Essentials add-on is part of that work, as discussed "
"throughout this article when talking about UIA workarounds, improving "
"support for apps and controls and others. But there are limits as to what "
"the add-on can do, as the other puzzle pieces are willingness from "
"developers (especially third-party UWP developers) to embrace accessibility "
"as a pillar in their apps, and willingness from users to send accessibility "
"feedback. Although some add-on features are being integrated into NVDA, "
"there are some areas where the add-on is needed (especially when supporting "
"features introduced in Windows Insider Preview builds), and until the day "
"accessibility is everywhere in Windows 10 ecosystem and universal apps, the "
"add-on will still be here."
