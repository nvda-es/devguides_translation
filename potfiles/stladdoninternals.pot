msgid "When transitioning between screen readers, one of the first things people might ask is inclusion of familiar features from old screen reader in the new product. As a user who have worked with multiple screen readers, I often ask this question when moving from one screen reader to another."

#: ..\python_docs\stladdoninternals.py:7
msgid "As more and more people are transitioning from JAWS for Windows to NVDA, a frequently asked question is whether NVDA has a dialog to show system tray (notification area) icons. By default, NVDA does not ship with such a feature, but it can be brought back with an add-on appropriately called \"SysTray List\". This add-on, developed by Rui Fontes and Rui Batista, allows you to view a list of system tray or taskbar icons, and this is the add-on we'll find out how it works in this add-on internals article."
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\stladdoninternals.py:8
msgid "To download the add-on, go to https://addons.nvda-project.org/addons/systrayList.en.html, and for the source code, go to http://bitbucket.org/nvdaaddonteam/systraylist. Just like the previous series on StationPlaylist Studio, you don't have to use the add-on to learn about its internals, but having the source code and/or using the add-on could help you as you understand how this add-on works behind the scenes."

msgid "A hidden gem of this add-on is that there is no command to view taskbar icons (that command is taken by NVDA's review cursor selection copy command (NvDA+F10)). Instead, to view taskbar icons, press NVDA+F11 twice quickly (more on how this is possible in a second). The list view changes to show taskbar icons (including pinned items). Pressing ENTER will cause NVDA to perform a left mouse click."

msgid "1. Determines if you pressed this command once or twice by calling scriptHandler.getLastScriptRepeatCount. If you press NvDA+F11 and then you press NVDA+F11 within the next half a second, NvDA will treat this as multiple press of this command."

msgid "Although the idea of listing system tray icons seems easy, there is a lot going on under the hood, involving locating the correct window via Windows API and carefully designing the user interface. This shows that designing a simple add-on like this involves careful thinking, especially if it'll be used by many users around the world. I hope this article was helpful in letting you understand how simple add-on suggestions are developed and designed."

msgid "Lastly, I would like to stress the fact that JAWS for Windows and NonVisual Desktop Access are two completely different screen readers. Although they have borrowed features from each other, the underlying philosophy, license type (proprietary and commercial for JAWS versus open-source and GPL for NvDA), design and programming language in use are different. Thus, please do not expect all JAWS functionality suggestions to be investigated by NV Access, or Freedom Scientific to borrow every feature from NVDA."
