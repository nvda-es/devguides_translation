"NV Access migrated tickets from our old issue tracker ('Trac') into Github "
"issues. These issues can be identified by having an author of "
"`nvaccessauto`. Some of these issues have comments that indicate an "
"attachment should be available, but it is not. All of these Trac attachments "
"are now accessible at: https://www.nvaccess.org/files/nvdaTracAttachments/ "
"(then the Github issue number). So as an example, for issue [#2396](https://"
"github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/2396), get the attachments from https://www."
"nvaccess.org/files/nvdaTracAttachments/2396"

"We differentiate between the priority for bugs (labelled `bug`) and new "
"features (labelled `feature`). Rather than assign a priority to issues with "
"the `feature` label, typically we try to group new features into a project "
"of related work. We should try to ensure that new features are [well defined]"
"(https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/wiki/Issue-triage-help#new-features-1) "
"before applying the `feature` label. One exception here might be if we can "
"determine that a feature is not something we are likely ever to work on. In "
"this case we should apply `P4` and explain this is not something we are "
"going to look at but will be happy to accept a pull request for. We also "
"have a label for `enhancement`, think of this as a more internal facing "
"change. For instance, editing code comments to provide clearer / more "
"complete information, or extending an internal framework/API to unblock "
"other issues."

"Due to the difficulty in assigning priorities to individual issues, recently "
"(2019) NV Access has asked members of the community to provide their top 2 "
"issues. This data allowed us to find trends resulting in a re-prioritisation "
"of our efforts. While this exercise allowed us to tackle the most important "
"issue for the majority, we are aware that critical issues for smaller groups "
"may be missed. So the above process should still be followed, especially for "
"P1 or P2 issues. If an issue is critical to you, please comment on the issue "
"and explain why."
