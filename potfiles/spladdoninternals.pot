"This guide has gone through many revisions, style changes, and updated to "

"In particular, trakc item class inheritance hierarchy has changed so many "

"Then came 2019, and so did Python 3, abstract classes, and new encoder "

"In 2020, the add-on has gone through another major change: removal of "
"unnecessary features and splitting broadcast profiles management from add-on "
"settings dialog. In the old days, add-on settings management was intimately "
"tied to broadcast profiles, and that was the reason why broadcast profiles "
"panel was an integral part of add-on settings dialog. In early 2020, several "
"bugs stemming from design decisions years ago came to light such as applying "
"settings changes to wrong profile. Together with a need to make add-on "
"settings panels independent of each other in order to allow users to open "
"alarms panel from anywhere (described later), it was decided to split "
"broadcast profiles panel into its own dialog."

"StationPlaylist add-on for NVDA consists of seven app modules (including two "
"app module packages) and a global plugin. Because Studio and Creator come "
"with Track Tool for managing tracks, the add-on includes an app module for "
"Track Tool in addition to the main app module package for Studio, as well as "
"an app module for StationPlaylist Creator. A fourth app module for Voice "
"Track Recorder is present which is used for event tracking purposes. Remote "
"VT client is the fifth app module and is mainly used to support remote "
"playlist editor. The other two app modules deal with Streamer and SPL DSP "
"Engine, with SPL Engine being an app module package due to inclusion of "
"encoders support module which is also used by Streamer."

#: ..\python_docs\spladdoninternals.py:56

"The overall design is that of a partnership between the main Studio app "
"module and the Studio Utilities (SPLUtils) global plugin. Studio app module "
"performs things expected from scripts such as responding to key presses, "
"announcing status information, configuration management and so forth, while "
"the global plugin is responsible for running Studio commands from anywhere, "
"and in older add-on releases, for encoder support (the add-on supports SAM, "
"SPL, and AltaCast encoders). In reality, the global plugin is subordinate to "
"the app module, as the app module controls overall functionality of the add-"
"on and because the global plugin requires Studio to be running to unlock "
"some features (here, unlock means using layer commands and parts of encoder "
"support)."
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\spladdoninternals.py:57
msgid ""
"When it comes to hierarchy of app modules, Studio app module package is "
"ranked highest. This is because Studio app module is the oldest part of the "
"add-on, and it provides base services and blueprints for other app modules. "
"For instance, Creator and Track Tool rely on configuration facility provided "
"by Studio app module package for Columns Explorer (explained later), and "
"Voice Track (VT) Recorder app module cannot function properly without Studio "
"app module running. Even though SPL Engine and Streamer are independent of "
"Studio app module, they still require Studio app module to function (this is "
"especially the case with SPL Engine, as Studio loads splengine.exe, the DSP "
"Engine executable)."

"* Easy to follow source code: Although some may say excessive documentation "

"There was an important reason for writing this feature: Since NVDA supports "

"profile."

"In March and April 2015, I started rewriting certain parts of add-on "

"broadcast profiles (now included as part of add-on 6.0). I started by "
"writing todo comments (where appropriate) describing what the future feature "
"should be like. I then modified initConfig and saveConfig (discussed in app "

"In June 2015, I opened a new branch (initially using the codename \"starfish"

"to learn more about how Jamie (James Teh from NV Access, now Mozilla) "
"implemented this feature. Once I understood how it worked, I copied, pasted "

"One of the first things I had to decide was how to store profiles. I "

"NV Access solved this problem (using separate ini files), implemented it, "
"and was met with another problem: transfering values between profiles. This "
"was resolved by specifying whether a setting was \"global\" (applies to all "
"profiles) or specific to a profile. Next came profile controls in the add-on "
