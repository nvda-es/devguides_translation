msgid "If you are a radio broadcaster, you might be accustomed to activities involved when producing a show. This may include playlist selection, scheduling break notes, responding to requests, monitoring listener count and encoding status and so on. To assist a broadcaster, a broadcast automation program is used, and one of the popular apps is called StationPlaylist Studio."

msgid "In NVDA Add-on Internals: StationPlaylist Studio, we'll learn about what Studio is and how the NVDA add-on works. You don't have to install or use the NVDA add-on to understand the ins and outs of this powerful add-on (using the add-on might help you better appreciate the defth of this material; for fuller experience, it is handy to have the add-on source code in front of you as you navigate this article). So let's get started by learning more about SPL Studio."

msgid "[StationPlaylist Studio](www.stationplaylist.com) is a broadcast automation software that helps broadcasters schedule trakcs, play jingles and more. It includes support for break notes, hourly playlist, track tagging and comes with tools to manage track playback such as setting track intros. In studio 5.00 and later, it includes its own stream encoder."

#: ..\python_docs\spladdoninternals.py:11
msgid "Is Studio accessible? Surprisingly, yes. It is possible to use Studio features without using screen reader scripts and add-ons. However, there are times when a broadcaster would use scripts, such as announcing status changes, monitoring track intros and endings, enhanced support for encoders and so on, and NVDA add-on for StationPlaylist Studio (usually refered to as SPL) accomplishes this well."

msgid "In 2011, Geoff Shang, a seasoned blind broadcaster, started working on SPL Studio add-on. This early version (numbered 0.01) was developed to let NVDA announce various status changes such as automation toggle and so on. This initial version, co-developed by James Teh (one of the lead developers of NVDA screen reader) was considered a quick project, and further development ceased until 2013."

#: ..\python_docs\spladdoninternals.py:14
msgid "In 2013, I (Joseph Lee) received several emails regarding NVDA's support for SPL Studio with a request for someone to write an add-on for it. As I was still new to add-on development then (this was after I developed Control Usage Assistant and GoldWave), I decided to take on this challenge in order to learn more Python and to practice what I learned in computer science labs at UC Riverside. I first downloaded the existing add-on (0.01) and installed Studio 5.01 on my computer to learn more about this program and to gather suggestions from SPL users. After little over a month of development and preview releases, I released Studio add-on 1.0 in January 2014."
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\spladdoninternals.py:15
msgid "Most of the early versions (1.x, 2.x, 3.x, released throughout 2014) were mostly quick projects that bridged the gap between NVDA and other screen readers (Brian Hartgen's JAWS scripts were my inspiration and have studied documentation for Jeff Bishop's Window-Eyes scripts). These early versions, supporting Studio 4.33 and later, were also used to fix bugs encountered by Studio users - for instance, a broadcaster posted  a YouTube video explaining how NVDA was not reading edit fields, which was fixed early on. Later releases (4.x, 5.x, 6.x, released throughout 2015), further bridged the gap with other screen readers and introduced unique features (for instance, add-on 5.0 introduced a configuration dialog, and 6.0 introduced concept of a broadcast profile). In late 2016, seeing that some of my add-ons were using year.month scheme for versioning, I decided to switch SPL to follow this model after receiving comments from the NVDA community. As of time of writing, add-on 17.06 just hit the air."

Yes, as you may need some basic exposure to programming such as what a variable is, conditional execution and so forth. On the flip side, you don't have to be a programmer to write about internal workings of an add-on (the basic requirement is passion for teaching and a hope for users to learn something new).

On the other side of the coin is scope of this article - this article does not serve as a definitive guide on add-on writing (there are documentation, linked at the end of this article that'll give you some basic overview). If you are familiar with add-on development and/or NVDA screen reader development and source code, you'll have slightly easier time understanding this article.

msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\spladdoninternals.py:42
msgid "The overall design is that of a partnership between the main Studio app module and the Studio Utilities (SPLUtils) global plugin. Studio app module performs things expected from scripts such as responding to key presses, announcing status information, configuration management and so forth, while the global plugin is responsible for running Studio commands from anywhere and for encoder support (the add-on supports SAM and SPL encoders). In reality, the global plugin is subordinate to the app module, as the app module controls overall functionality of the add-on and because the global plugin requires Studio to be running to unlock some features (here, unlock means using layer commands and encoder support)."

First, the overlay classes for track items are defined, then comes the app module, further divided into four sections: fundamental methods (constructor, events and others), time commands (end of track, broadcaster time, etc.), other commands (track Finder, cart explorer and others) and SPL Assistant layer. This allows me to identify where a bug is coming from and to add features in appropriate sections."

msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\spladdoninternals.py:49
msgid "When I set out to write the add-on in 2013, I put forth certain things the add-on should adhere to, including:"
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\spladdoninternals.py:50
msgid "* Consistency: The add-on should have a consistent interface and command structure. Interface includes various GUI's such as add-on configuration dialog. For layer commands, I tried using native Studio command assignments."
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\spladdoninternals.py:51
msgid "* Extensibility: The add-on should be organized and written in such a way that permits easy extensibility, hence the app module and the global plugin were divided into submodules, with each of them being a specialist of some kind (such as configuration management)."
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\spladdoninternals.py:52
msgid "* Separation of concerns: Coupled with extensibility, this allowed me to provide just needed commands at the right time, which resulted in two layer command sets (explained below)."
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\spladdoninternals.py:53
msgid "* Easy to follow source code: Although some may say excessive documentation is a noise, I believe it is important for a developer to understand how a function or a module came about. Also, I have used and read user guides for other screen reader scripts to better understand how a feature worked and come up with some enhancements to a point where I found some major bugs with JAWS scripts (one of them, which I hope Brian patched by now is microphone alarm where the alarm would go off despite the fact that microphone was turned off before alarm timeout has expired)."
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\spladdoninternals.py:54
msgid "* Unique feature labels: One way to stand out was to give features interesting names. For instance, during add-on 3.0 development, I decided to give cart learn mode a name that better reflects what the feature does: Cart Explorer to explore cart assignments. Same could be set about NVDA's implementation of enhanced arrow keys (called Track Dial, as the feature is similar to flipping a dial on a remote control)."
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\spladdoninternals.py:55
msgid "* Extensive collaboration and feedback cycle between users and developers: I believed that the real stars of the show were not the add-on code files, but broadcasters who'll use various add-on features. Because of this, I worked with users early on, and their continued feedback shapes future add-on releases. This collaboration and feedback cycle also helped me (the add-on author) understand how the add-on was used and to plan future features to meet the needs of broadcasters who may use this add-on in various scenarios (a good example is broadcast profiles, as you'll see in add-on configuration section)."

msgid "### Why two layer sets?"
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\spladdoninternals.py:57
msgid "When I first sat down to design the add-on, I knew I had to write both an app module and a global plugin (to perform Studio commands from anywhere), which led to defining two layer command sets for specific purposes:"
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\spladdoninternals.py:58
msgid "* SPL Assistant: This layer command set is available in the app module and is intended to obtain status information and to manage app module features. I called this Assistant because this layer serves as an assistant to a broadcaster in reading various status information. More details can be found later in this article."
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\spladdoninternals.py:59
msgid "* SPL Controller: This layer is for the global plugin and performs Studio commands from anywhere. I called this \"controller\" because it controls various functions of Studio from other programs. More details will be provided below."
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\spladdoninternals.py:60
msgid "In the early days, I enforced this separation, but in add-on 6.0, it is possible to invoke SPL Assistant layer by pressing the command used to invoke SPL Controller. In add-on 7.0, it is possible for SPL Assistant to emulate commands from other screen reader scripts, and the mechanics of it is covered later in this article."

msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\spladdoninternals.py:63
msgid "* Dynamic Command:script binding and removal: It is possible to bind gestures dynamically via bindGesture/bindGestures method for an app module or a global plugin (bindGesture binds a single command to a script, whereas bindGestures binds commands to scripts from a gestures map or another container). To remove gesture map dynamically, the main/layer gestures combo was cleared, then the main gestures were bound."
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\spladdoninternals.py:64
msgid "* Use of two or more gesture maps in the app module/global plugin: Normally, an app module or a global plugin that accepts keyboard input uses a single gestures map (called __gestures; a map is another term for dictionaries or associative array where there is a value tied to a key). But in order for layers to work, a second gestures map was provided to store layer commands (command and the bound script of the form \"command\":\"script\")."
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\spladdoninternals.py:65
msgid "* Wrapped functions: Tyler used \"wraps\" decorator from functools to wrap how \"finally\" function is called from within the layer set (this was needed to remove bindings for layer commands after they are done). Also, a custom implementation of getScript function (app module/global plugin) was used to return either the main script of the layer version depending on context."

msgid "3. You press a command in the layer set (such as A from Assistant to hear automation status, or press A to turn automation on if using SPL Controller layer). Depending on how the layer script is implemented, it either calls Studio API (for SPL Controller layer and for some Assistant commands) or simulates object navigation to fetch needed information (Assistant layer). In the app module, for performance reasons, the object is cached. More details on mechanics of this procedure in subsequent sections."

msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\spladdoninternals.py:78
msgid "In order to use services offered by Studio, one has to use Studio API, which in turn requires one to keep an eye on window handle to Studio (in Windows API, a window handle (just called handle) is a reference to something, such as a window, a file, connection routines and so on). This is important if one wishes to perform Studio commands from other programs (Studio uses messages to communicate with the outside program in question via user32.dll's SendMessage function)."
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\spladdoninternals.py:79
msgid "Starting from add-on 7.0, one of the activities the app module performs when started (besides announcing the version of Studio you are using) is to look for the handle to Studio's main window until it is found (this is done via a thread which calls user32.dll's FindWindowA (not FindWindowW) function every second), and once found, the app module caches this information for later use. A similar check is performed by SPL Controller command, as without this, SPL Controller is useless (as noted earlier). Because of the prominence of the Studio API and the window handle, one of the first things I do whenver new versions of Studio is released is to ask for the latest Studio API and modify the app module and/or global plugin accordingly."

For example, when a check box is checked, NVDA will say \"checked\"\" - NVDA will know if you checked this box because the underlying accessibility API informs NVDA of this change, and the same information is spoken regardless of whether it is dealing with IAccessible, UIA and so on."

Adding to the urgency was the fact that Studio 5.10 uses check marks to indicate whether a track is selected for playback (Studio 5.0x and earlier uses check boxes), and when check marks are checked in Studio 5.10, NVDA would not announce newly checked state, fixed by defining a routine to be used when SPACE is pressed (via an overlay class).

Given that I had experience with overlay classes and since there was already an overlay class for Studio 5.10 track items, I decided to go with the latter option, which led to defining a new overlay class for Studio 5.0x track items and letting 5.10 track items inherit from this new class."

#: ..\python_docs\spladdoninternals.py:748
msgid "There was an important reason for writing this feature: Since NVDA supports multiple configuration profiles and since some broadcasters were hosting multiple shows, I thought it would be a good idea to implement a similar feature in the SPL add-on. Thus, I envisioned broadcast profiles to be used primarily by people hosting multiple shows, with each show defined as a profile."
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\spladdoninternals.py:749
msgid "In March and April 2015, I started rewriting certain parts of add-on configuration manager (splstudio.splconfig) in preparation for developing broadcast profiles (now included as part of add-on 6.0). I started by writing todo comments (where appropriate) describing what the future feature should be like. I then modified initConfig and saveConfig (discussed in app module articles), initially telling them to work with the default profile (the one and only configuration map then), then I left it alone until add-on 5.0 was released in June 2015."

I experimented with using ConfigObj sections, one per profile, but this proved to be problematic (a profile could be given the name of an existing configuration map key). I then went back to NVDA source code to find out how NV Access solved this problem (using separate ini files), implemented it, and was met with another problem: transfering values between profiles. This was resolved by specifying whether a setting was \"global\" (applies to all profiles) or specific to a profile. Next came profile controls in the add-on settings dialog and using choice events to set alarm values using values from the selected profile."

This involved tracking how many threads were running to make sure no unnecessary threads were running, catching suttle errors and race conditions (a connection attempt could run a thread without checking if the encoder is being monitored) and so on. Thankfully, I went through a similar set of problems a few months earlier when I struggled with library scan (add-on 4.0), and that experience taught me to be careful with threads (and to experience fewer headaches)."

Thank you users for your continued support and feedback, and I promise once again that all my add-on code (including SPL Studio add-on) will be free and anyone is welcome to study and improve upon it."
