"Some users (especially those using USB audio hardware) report a short chunk "
"of audio being cut off either at the beginning or the end of speech. This "
"may be caused by the fact that NVDA opens and closes the audio device for "
"every speech utterance. It is possible that some audio drivers take slightly "
"longer to open the device and drop some initial blocks. Similarly, when "
"closing the device, some audio hardware may throw away the final blocks, "
"rather than ensuring they have been played before closing. "

"We could consider keeping the audio device open for several seconds after "
"speech finishes so that all audio is played, and so that the audio device "
"does not have to be opened again if more speech is coming soon. We could "

"There is a possibility that several system crashes reported by users may be "
"due to NVDA opening and closing the audio device too aggressively. "
"Similarly, some users on low-end hardware report general lag and bad "
"responsiveness. This may possibly be due to the  audio driver taking time to "
"open the device for all speech utterances."

"We also may have multiple code paths opening, writing to and closing the "
"audio device at the same time. E.g. the tones module for beeps, may hold the "
"audio device open all the time. It may be an idea to somehow integrate all "
"this so that audio only goes through one final code path that serializes "

"- NVDA receives a great deal more events from the system than other standard "

"The majority of the work to make an x64 variant of NVDA is to change the "

"architecture. Right now there are some specialized situations where NVDA "
