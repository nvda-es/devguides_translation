"Python is one of the popular programming languages for various projects. Its "
"ease of learning, extensive standard library modules and third-party "

"Currently there are two major branches of Python: 2.x, released in early "
"2000's, and 3.x, first released in 2008. At first glance, Python 3 may seem "
"similar to Python 2, but there are numerous deeper differences which break "
"backwards compatibility with code written for Python 2. These including "
"extensive Unicode support in Python 3, module renames, changes to imports, "
"changes to division, and many more."

"When NVDA began in 2006, it used python 2.4. Over the years, NVDA and its "
"add-ons were written in Python 2.7. Support for Python 2.7 is ending, it "
"will no longer receive updates (performance, security, or bug fixes). For "
"this reason, the longevity of NVDA depends on moving to Python 3."
