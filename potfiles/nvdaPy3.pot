msgid "Currently there are two major branches of Python: 2.x, released in early 2000's, and 3.x, first released in 2008. At first glance, Python 3 may seem similar to Python 2, but there are numerous deeper differences which break backwards compatibility with code written for Python 2. These including extensive Unicode support in Python 3, module renames, changes to imports, changes to division, and many more."
