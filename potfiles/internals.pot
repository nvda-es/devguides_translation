msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\internals.py:84
msgid ""
"NVDA is primarily written in the [Python programming language](http://www."

"in C++ for high performance."

msgid "### Accessibility APIs"
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\internals.py:87
msgid ""
"In order to make graphical widgets accessible to assistive technologies, "
"operating systems and applications can use special purpose accessibility "
"APIs. These APIs provide information about the widget such as its name, type/"
"role (button, check box, editable text field, etc.), description, value, "
"states (checked, unavailable, invisible, etc.) and keyboard shortcut. "
"Accessibility APIs also provide events to allow assistive technologies to "
"monitor changes, such as when the focus changes, properties of an object "
"(such as name, description, value, and state) change, etc. Rich "
"accessibility APIs provide additional information, including the ability to "
"access detailed information about and track the cursor in editable text "
"controls, and table information such as row and column coordinates. NVDA "
"relies heavily on accessibility APIs to gather information. Several "
"accessibility APIs are used, including Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA) "
"(also known as IAccessible), [IAccessible2](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/"
"en/Accessibility/IAccessible2), Java Access Bridge and UI Automation."

msgid "### Native APIs"
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\internals.py:89
msgid ""
"Some widgets do not expose sufficient information via accessibility APIs to "
"make them fully accessible. For example, MSAA, which is the accessibility "
"API used by most standard Windows controls, does not provide the ability to "
"obtain the location of the cursor or retrieve individual units of text in "
"editable text fields. However, some widgets provide their own native APIs "
"(not specific to accessibility) which can be used to obtain this "
"information. NVDA makes use of these APIs where possible; e.g. in standard "
"edit controls."

msgid "### Operating System Functions"
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\internals.py:91
msgid ""
"Aside from accessibility and native APIs, Windows provides many functions "
"which can be used to obtain information and perform tasks. Information that "
"can be obtained includes the class name of a window, the current foreground "
"window and system battery status. Tasks that can be performed include moving/"
"clicking the mouse and sending key presses."

"The launcher is the module which the user executes to start NVDA. It is "

msgid "1. If update check is in progress, tells update check to quit."
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\internals.py:119
