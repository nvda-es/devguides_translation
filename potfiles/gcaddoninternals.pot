"A graphical user interface isn't complete without means of moving around the "
"screen and interacting with various elements. For years, a computer mouse "
"was a handy tool for working with graphical elements, with touchscreens and "
"mixed reality replacing functions of the mouse for some people. Even with "
"the introduction of the mouse in the 1970's and move towards touch "
"interaction in the 21st century, one input device has stil remained king of "
"computer interaction: keyboards."

"For many blind people, the concept of using a mouse (or touch interaction) "
"may sound foreign, especially for people used to textual interfaces. For "
"some people, using the mouse as a blind person was only a dream. Recent "
"advancements in screen reading has bridged the gap somewhat, although there "
"are areas that still need work, including describing cursor colors, more "
"accuracy in mouse cursor shape announcement and so on, as well as ability to "
"move the mouse with a keyboard. Fortunately, the last advancement is now a "
"reality thanks to an add-on we'll be examining in this article: Golden "
"Cursor."

"Simply speaking, Golden Cursor is an add-on that allows NVDA users to "
"manipulate the mouse via keyboard. Although Windows does have mouse keys, a "
"keyboard with a physical numpad is required to take full advantage of this. "
"On the other hand, Golden Cursor does not require a physical numpad, thus "
"making it a bit more universal. Even though the add-on has seen little "
"development activity, it is still an interesting add-on to study, as it "
"showcases the enthusiasm the NVDA community has shown for this add-on, and a "
"chance for the author of this article to improve the add-on and present its "
"inner workings. In \"NVDA Add-on Internals: Golden Cursor\", we'll learn the "
"history behind this add-on, recent developments, and dive into how this add-"
"on improves mouse usability for blind people around the world."

"Towards end of 2015, an Arabic-speaking NVDA translator contacted NVDA add-"
"ons team and introduced the community to an add-on a friend of the "
"translator was developing. Called \"Golden Cursor\", the add-on came with "
"keyboard commands to manipulate the mouse. Since the community has shown "
"interest in this add-on, I decided to contact the developer and review the "
"new add-on."

"Eventually some serious issues were resolved, and after working closely with "

"In 2017, I (Joseph Lee) announced an initiative to modernize community add-"
"ons by making them work well under Python 3, and naturally Golden Cursor was "
"one of those add-ons that needed modernization. The problem was that the "
"community lost contact with the original developers of this add-on, thus I "
"volunteered to modernize this add-on. Thus the below notes are based on old "
"add-on releases, as well as results of modernization work done throughout "
"2018."

msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\gcaddoninternals.py:18
msgid ""
"Simply put, the add-on serves as a \"keyboard wheel\" for a computer mouse. "
"This is made more intuitive by the fact that Windows+NvDA+arrow keys (or "
"just arrow keys with mouse arrows layer turned on) were assigned to move the "
"mouse. In addition, hotspot functionality is available where a mouse "
"coordinate (xy) is tagged with a label and jumped to, as well as giving "
"users ability to move to a specific mouse coordinate location. The "
"coordinate tag is then stored in a file that looks like a typical ini file, "
"allowing easy sharing between systems."
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\gcaddoninternals.py:19
msgid ""
"The \"wheel\" is actually a call to SetCursorPos Windows API function, "
"wrapped inside winUser module (as winUser module wraps user32.dll), "
"ultimately controlled by moveMouse method in the add-on. The moveMouse "
"method takes the mouse direction flag, and based on cursor location, "
"direction given and mouse restriction flag, positions the mouse cursor on "
"the new location. The direction flags are:"

msgid "The moveMouse routine is as follows:"
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\gcaddoninternals.py:25
msgid ""
"1. Obtains the current mouse location by calling GetCursorPos function, "
"which returns current X and Y mouse coordinates."
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\gcaddoninternals.py:26
msgid ""
"2. Calculates the new mouse location based on direction given and movement "
"unit (movement unit can range from 1 to 100 pixels; a pixel (picture "
"element) is a very small square on displays used to hold display output, "
"such as color, intensity and others, and displays ship with millions of "
"pixels). For example, if Control=Windows+right arrow is pressed, since we're "
"moving to the right, new X coordinate will be current X coordinate plus the "
"movement unit. Similarly, if Contorl+Windows+left arrow is pressed, the new "
"X coordinate will be current coordinate minus the movement unit."
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\gcaddoninternals.py:27
msgid ""
"3. If mouse restriction is set (that is, if a mouse is told to stay at the "
"current application), the new locatin will be somewhere inside the "
"restircted application, otherwise mouse will move. Then SetCursorPos "
"function is claled to plce the mouse on the new location."
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\gcaddoninternals.py:28
msgid ""
"4. The add-on also includes ability to announce mouse coordinates, and if "
"this is true, new coordinate (at least the new X or Y coordinate) will be "
"announced."
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\gcaddoninternals.py:29
msgid ""
"Mouse coordinate tag and jumping to a specific coordinate is a variation of "
"the above mechanism. When one wishes to move mouse to another location, one "
"can invoke mouse jump dialog and type the new coordinate (x, then comma, "
"then y value). Similarly, when one wishes to mark a mouse locatoin with a "
"tag, one can move th mouse to the desired location and open positions "
"dilaog, give it a label nad press Enter, with the tag saved to an ini file "
"named for the app name with the file extension of .gc (for example, outlook."
"gc for mouse tags for Microsoft Outlook). Then one can invoke positions list "
"dialog, select a tag, and press Enter to move the mouse to the tagged "
"location, with the positoins list dilaog also providing means to rename, "
"delete or clear the tag for the application."

"Besides mouse movement commands, the add-on comes with two option flags to "

"For people familiar with mathematical representation of a 2D graph or a "
"plane, the ideal starting point (or origin) would be center, or for computer "
"monitors, bottom left. However, on Windows, the starting point is top left. "
"For example, on a 1920 by 1080 pixel display, the top left is (0, 0), and "
"top right is (1920, 0). Using this logic, we can see that bottom left is (0, "
"1080), and bottom right is (1920, 1080). Note that you need to subtract one "
"from the maximum, so the coordinate for the bottom right corner becomes "
"(1919, 1079)."

"It is said that the simple something is, the better. The Golden Cursor add-"

"reality. Time will tell how this add-on will evolve to meet people's needs, "
"and some useful ideas are already being planned by the community."
