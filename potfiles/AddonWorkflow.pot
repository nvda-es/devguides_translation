"\tAs the community of nvda users and addon authors grow, we want to promote "

"\tThat as adon authors we take our volunteer work seriously, and we "

#: ..\python_docs\AddonWorkflow.py:45

msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\AddonWorkflow.py:47

msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\AddonWorkflow.py:48

"\tCriticism of code is not a criticism against the author, it is simply "

#: ..\python_docs\AddonWorkflow.py:49

#: ..\python_docs\AddonWorkflow.py:53
msgid ""
"\tIt was felt that more time was spent trying to administrate the system, "
"than to be able to do the interesting work of reviewing and giving feedback, "
"therefore more steps should be automated."

#: ..\python_docs\AddonWorkflow.py:55
msgid ""
"\tWith less complex requirements for a potential addon reviewer, hopefully "
