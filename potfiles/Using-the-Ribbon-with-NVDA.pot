"The ribbons in Windows, whether in File Explorer or specific programs like "
"MS-Word or others, are really just another variant on a menu system that has "

"Many of the things you already know for using a menu-driven system still "
"apply for accessing the ribbons.  In the old-style menus you hit ALT plus "
"the appropriate letter to drop down that menu.  In the ribbon system you hit "
"ALT plus the appropriate letter to open a specific tab that shows the ribbon "
"you need to access."

"Every blessed option on a ribbon has a direct keyboard shortcut to activate "
"it, so it is worth learning what your own “greatest hits” generally are and "
"what their keyboard shortcuts are to save yourself a lot of time.  That "
"being said, we all occasionally have to use a feature that we seldom use, so "
"on occasion a brute force “tab by tab” search, either through a whole ribbon "
"or within select groups on a given ribbon might be needed."

"One big difference between using the old-style menu system and ribbons is "
"that the up, down, left, and right arrow keys were your primary navigation "
"keys for menus.  They are not for ribbon navigation.  Your primary "
"navigation key is the TAB key, along with CTRL+Right Arrow (or Left Arrow) "
"if you wish to jump from ribbon group to ribbon group."

"What follows will use File Explorer as the program and its various buttons "
"and ribbons.  This is from a system running Windows 10, Version 1607 (the "
"Anniversary Update), Build 14393.187.  I do not recall having customized "
"File Explorer in any way, so this should apply to File Explorer in its “out "
"of the box” state.  The principles of navigation of the ribbon apply in any "
"program that uses one, but the buttons and ribbons in other programs "
"obviously differ."

"Learning the actual keyboard shortcuts for functions that you use all the "

"bullet lists in your Microsoft Word documents on a routine basis it’s a lot "

"the one you want than to hit ALT+H, CTRL+Right Arrow three times to get to "
"the Paragraph control grouping, Enter to open the bullet list dialog (which "
"happens to be the first control in the Paragraph group), then down arrowing "
"through the bullet styles.  Also using keyboard shortcuts like CTRL+B to "
"toggle bold type on/off, CTRL+I for italic, and CTRL+U for underline, is "
"much faster than hunting for these in the Font Group via ribbon navigation."
