"Occasionally changes have to be made to NVDA that will break compatibility "
"with prior versions of the public API. In order to make this predictable for "
"add-on authors, NV Access has adopted a schedule. The first release of each "
"year (starting with 2021.1) will be the opportunity to remove deprecated "
"code, or make other compatibility breaking design changes. Other releases "
"will aim to maintain compatibility, sometimes keeping code but marking it as "
"deprecated. When marking code as deprecated, the definition should have a "
"comment to explain such and the PR that introduces the change will be tagged "
"with the `deprecated/20YY.1`. Where `YY` is the release year."
