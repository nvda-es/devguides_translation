"When reporting problems, it is often useful to provide an NVDA log file. "
"This file shows what NVDA was doing when the problem occurred. Sometimes, a "
"particular problem is difficult to reproduce or not reproduceable at all on "
"other systems, so the log file can act as a further description or recording "
"of the problem as it happened."

"A log file should be attached to a GitHub issue at the same time or after it "
"is created. It is important not to simply paste fragments or entire log "
"files in to an issue comment, as this clutters the issue and may mangle "

"By default, NVDA's log level is set to `Info`. This means that only "
"informational messages, warning messages and major error messages are "
"logged. This level of logging may be useful for crashes of NVDA or when "
"nothing better is available. However, in order to provide much more detail, "
"you can set NVDA's log level to `Debug` (In General Settings under "
"Preferences in the NVDA menu) before the error occurs. Setting the log level "
"to `Debug` tells NVDA to also log information such as what keys were "
"pressed, what was spoken and other messages to help developers diagnose "
"problems. Although this detail will help a great deal in solving the issue, "
"please be aware that because key presses and spoken messages are logged, the "
"log may contain personal information."
