"","",_(u"""## 1\\. Introduction"""),
"",_(u"""This guide provides information concerning NVDA development, including translation and the development of components for NVDA. """),
"",_(u"""### 1.1. A Note About Python"""),
"",_(u"""NVDA and its components are primarily written in the Python programming language. It is not the goal of this guide to teach you Python, though examples are provided through out this guide which will help to familiarise you with the Python syntax. Documentation and other resources related to the Python language can be found at [www.python.org/](http://www.python.org/)"""),
"",_(u"""## 2\\. Translation"""),
"",_(u"""In order to support multiple languages/locales, NVDA must be translated and data specific to the locale must be provided. This section only includes information on custom NVDA file formats required for translation. Other items need to be translated, such as the NVDA user interface and documentation, but these use standard file formats. For complete documentation about translating NVDA, please see <https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/wiki/Translating>"""),
"",_(u"""### 2.1. Character Descriptions"""),
"",_(u"""Sometimes, it can be very difficult or even impossible to distinguish one character from another. For example, two characters might be pronounced the same way, even though they are actually different characters. To help users when this occurs, character descriptions can be provided which describe the character in a unique way. """),
"",_(u"""Character descriptions can be provided for a locale in a file named characterDescriptions.dic in the directory for the locale. This is a UTF-8 encoded text file. Blank lines and lines beginning with a \"\\#\" character are ignored. All other lines should contain a character, followed by a tab, then one or more descriptions separated by tabs. """),
"",_(u"""For example: """),
_(u"""    """),
_(u"""    """),
"",_(u"""    # This is a comment."""),
"",_(u"""    a	alpha"""),
"",_(u"""    b	bravo"""),
"",_(u"""    """),
"",_(u"""See the file locale\\en\\characterDescriptions.dic for a full example. """),
"",_(u"""In most cases, the characters in this file should be a single lower case character. It is assumed that characters will have the same description regardless of their case, so upper case characters are converted to lower case before looking up their character descriptions. """),
"",_(u"""### 2.2. Symbol Pronunciation"""),
"",_(u"""It is often useful to hear punctuation and other symbols pronounced as words when reading text, particularly when moving by character. Unfortunately, the pronunciation of symbols is inconsistent between speech synthesisers and many synthesisers do not speak many symbols and/or do not allow control over what symbols are spoken. Therefore, NVDA allows information about symbol pronunciation to be provided. """),
"",_(u"""This is done for a locale by providing a file named symbols.dic in the directory for the locale. This is a UTF-8 encoded text file. Blank lines and lines beginning with a \"\\#\" character are ignored. All locales implicitly inherit the symbol information for English, though any of this information can be overridden. """),
"",_(u"""The file contains two sections. """),
"",_(u"""#### 2.2.1. Defining Complex Symbols"""),
"",_(u"""The first section is optional and defines regular expression patterns for complex symbols. Complex symbols are symbols which aren't simply a character or sequence of characters, but instead require a more complicated match. An example is the full stop \\(.\\) sentence ending in English. The \".\" is used for multiple purposes, so a more complicated check is required to determine whether this refers to the end of a sentence. """),
"",_(u"""The complex symbols section begins with the line: """),
_(u"""    """),
_(u"""    """),
"",_(u"""    complexSymbols:"""),
"",_(u"""    """),
"",_(u"""Subsequent lines contain a textual identifier used to identify the symbol, a tab and the regular expression pattern for that symbol. For example: """),
_(u"""    """),
_(u"""    """),
"",_(u"""    . sentence ending	(?<=[^\\s.])\\.(?=[\\\"')\\s]|$)"""),
"",_(u"""    dates with .	\\b(\\d\\d)\\.(\\d\\d)\\.(\\d{2}|\\d{4})\\b"""),
"",_(u"""    """),
"",_(u"""Again, the English symbols are inherited by all other locales, so you need not include any complex symbols already defined for English. """),
"",_(u"""#### 2.2.2. Defining Symbol Information"""),
"",_(u"""The second section provides information about when and how to pronounce all symbols. It begins with the line: """),
_(u"""    """),
_(u"""    """),
"",_(u"""    symbols:"""),
"",_(u"""    """),
"",_(u"""Subsequent lines should contain several fields separated by tabs. The only mandatory fields are the identifier and replacement. The default will be used for omitted fields. The fields are as follows: """),
"",_(u"""  * identifier: The identifier of the symbol. In most cases, this is just the character or characters of the symbol. However, it can also be the identifier of a complex symbol. Certain characters cannot be typed into the file, so the following special sequences can be used: """),
_(u"""    * \\0: null """),
_(u"""    * \\t: tab """),
_(u"""    * \\n: line feed """),
_(u"""    * \\r: carriage return """),
_(u"""    * \\f: form feed """),
_(u"""    * \\\\\\#: \\# character \\(needed because \\# at the start of a line denotes a comment\\) """),
_(u"""  * replacement: The text which should be spoken for the symbol. If the symbol is a complex symbol, \\1, \\2, etc. can be used to refer to the groups matches, which will be inlined in the replacement, allowing for simpler rules. This also means that to get a \\ character in the replacement, one has to type \\\\\\\\. """),
_(u"""  * level: The symbol level at which the symbol should be spoken. The symbol level is configured by the user and specifies the amount of symbols that should be spoken. This field should contain one of the levels \"none\", \"some\", \"most\", \"all\" or \"char\", or \"-\" to use the default. \"char\" means that the symbol should only be pronounced when moving by character. The default is to inherit the value or \"all\" if there is nothing to inherit. """),
_(u"""  * preserve: Whether the symbol itself should be preserved to facilitate correct pronunciation by the synthesiser. For example, symbols which cause pauses or inflection \\(such as the comma in English\\) should be preserved. This field should be one of the following: """),
_(u"""    * never: Never preserve the symbol. """),
_(u"""    * always: Always preserve the symbol. """),
_(u"""    * norep: Only preserve the symbol if it is not being replaced; i.e. the user has set symbol level lower than the level of this symbol. """),
_(u"""    * -: Use the default.  The default is to inherit the value or \"never\" if there is nothing to inherit. """),
"","",_(u"""Finally, a display name for the symbol can be provided in a comment after a tab at the end of the line. This will be shown to users when editing the symbol information and is especially useful for translators to define translated names for English complex symbols. """),
"",_(u"""Here are some examples: """),
_(u"""    """),
_(u"""    """),
"",_(u"""    (	left paren	most"""),
"",_(u"""    """),
"",_(u"""This means that the \"\\(\" character should be spoken as \"left paren\" only when the symbol level is set to most or higher; i.e. most or all. """),
_(u"""    """),
_(u"""    """),
"",_(u"""    ,	comma	all	always"""),
"",_(u"""    """),
"",_(u"""This means that the \",\" character should be spoken as \"comma\" when the symbol level is set to all and that the character itself should always be preserved so that the synthesiser will pause appropriately. """),
_(u"""    """),
_(u"""    """),
"",_(u"""    . sentence ending	point	# . fin de phrase"""),
"",_(u"""    """),
"",_(u"""This line appears in the French symbols.dic file. It means that the \". sentence ending\" complex symbol should be spoken as \"point\". Level and preserve are not specified, so they will be taken from English. A display name is provided so that French users will know what the symbol represents. """),
_(u"""    """),
_(u"""    """),
"",_(u"""    dates with .	\\1 point \\2 point \\3	all	norep	# date avec points"""),
"",_(u"""    """),
"",_(u"""This line appears in the French symbols.dic file. It means that the first, second, and third groups of the match will be included, separated by the word 'point'. The effect is thus to replace the dots from the date with the word 'point'. """),
"",_(u"""Please see the file locale\\en\\symbols.dic for the English definitions which are inherited for all locales. This is also a good full example. """),
"",_(u"""## 3\\. Plugins"""),
"",_(u"""### 3.1. Overview"""),
"",_(u"""Plugins allow you to customize the way NVDA behaves overall or within a particular application. They are able to: """),
"",_(u"""  * Respond to particular events such as focus and object property changes; e.g. when a control changes its name. """),
_(u"""  * Implement commands which are bound to particular key presses or other input. """),
_(u"""  * Customise the behaviour of and implement additional functionality for particular controls. """),
_(u"""  * Customise or add new support for text content and complex documents. """),
"","",_(u"""This section provides an introduction to developing plugins. Developers should consult the code documentation for a complete reference. """),
"",_(u"""### 3.2. Types of Plugins"""),
"",_(u"""There are two types of plugins. These are: """),
"",_(u"""  * App Modules: code specific to a particular application. The App Module receives all events for a particular application, even if that application is not currently active. When the application is active, any commands that the App Module has bound to key presses or other input can be executed by the user. """),
_(u"""  * Global Plugins: code global to NVDA; i.e. it is used in all applications. Global Plugins Receive all events for all controls in the Operating System. Any commands bound by a Global Plugin can be executed by the user wherever they are in the operating system, regardless of application. """),
"","",_(u"""If you wish to improve NVDA's access to a particular application, it is most likely you will want to write an App Module. In contrast, if you wish to add some overall functionality to NVDA \\(e.g. a script that announces current Wireless network strength while in any application\\), then a Global Plugin is what you want. """),
"",_(u"""Both App Modules and Global Plugins share a common look and feel. They are both Python source files \\(with a .py extension\\), they both define a special class containing all events, scripts and bindings, and they both may define custom classes to access controls, text content and complex documents. However, they do differ in some ways. """),
"",_(u"""Custom appModules and globalPlugins can be packaged into NVDA add-ons. This allows easy distribution, and provides a safe way for the user to install and uninstall the custom code. Please refer to the Add-ons section later on in this document. """),
"",_(u"""In order to test the code while developing, you can place it in a special 'scratchpad' directory in your NVDA user configuration directory. You will also need to configure NVDA to enable loading of custom code from the Developer Scratchpad Directory, by enabling this in the Advanced category of NVDA's Settings dialog. The Advanced category also contains a button to easily open the Developer Scratchpad directory if enabled. """),
"",_(u"""The following few sections will talk separately about App Modules and Global Plugins. After this point, discussion is again more general. """),
"",_(u"""### 3.3. Basics of an App Module"""),
"",_(u"""App Module files have a .py extension, and are named the same as either the main executable of the application for which you wish them to be used or the package inside a host executable. For example, an App Module for notepad would be called notepad.py, as notepad's main executable is called notepad.exe. For apps hosted inside host executables, see the section on app modules for hosted apps. """),
"",_(u"""App Module files must be placed in the appModules subdirectory of an add-on, or of the scratchpad directory of the NVDA user configuration directory. """),
"",_(u"""App Modules must define a class called AppModule, which inherits from appModuleHandler.AppModule. This class can then define event and script methods, gesture bindings and other code. This will all be covered in depth later. """),
"",_(u"""NVDA loads an App Module for an application as soon as it notices the application is running. The App Module is unloaded once the application is closed or when NVDA is exiting. """),
"",_(u"""### 3.4. Example 1: An App Module that Beeps on Focus Change Events"""),
"",_(u"""The following example App Module makes NVDA beep each time the focus changes within the notepad application. This example shows you the basic layout of an App Module. """),
"",_(u"""Copy and paste the code between \\(but not including\\) the start and end markers into a new text file called notepad.py, which should be saved in the AppModules subdirectory. Be very careful to keep all tabs and spaces intact. """),
"",_(u"""Once saved in the correct location, either restart NVDA or choose Reload Plugins found under Tools in the NVDA menu. """),
"",_(u"""Finally, open Notepad and move the focus around the application; e.g. move along the menu bar, open some dialog boxes, etc. You should hear beeps each time the focus changes. Note though that if you move outside of Notepad - for instance, to Windows Explorer - you do not hear beeps. """),

"",_(u"""### 3.5. App modules for hosted apps"""),
"",_(u"""Some executables host various apps inside. These include javaw.exe for running various java programs and wwahost.exe for some apps in Windows 8 and later. """),
"",_(u"""If an app runs inside a host executable, the name of the app module must be the name as defined by the host executable, which can be found through AppModule.appName property. For example, an app module for a java app named \"test\" hosted inside javaw.exe must be named test.py. For apps hosted inside wwahost, not only must the app module name be the name of the loaded app, but the app module must subclass the app module class found in wwahost. """),

More information about scripts and the script decorator can be found in the Defining script properties section of this guide. """),
"",_(u"""As with other examples in this guide, remember to delete the created Global Plugin when finished testing and then restart NVDA or reload plugins, so that original functionality is restored. """),
"",_(u"""### 3.9. NVDA Objects"""),
"",_(u"""NVDA represents controls and other GUI elements as NVDA Objects. These NVDA Objects contain standardised properties, such as name, role, value, states and description, which allow other parts of NVDA to query or present information about a control in a generalised way. For example, the OK button in a dialog would be represented as an NVDA Object with a name of \"OK\" and a role of button. Similarly, a checkbox with a label of \"I agree\" would have a name of \"I agree\", a role of checkbox, and if currently checked, a state of checked. """),
"",_(u"""As there are many different GUI Toolkits and platform and accessibility APIs, NVDA Objects abstract these differences into a standard form that NVDA can use, regardless of the toolkit or API a particular control is made with. For example, the Ok button just discussed could be a widget in a Java application, an MSAA object, an IAccessible2 object or a UI Automation element. """),
"",_(u"""NVDA Objects have many properties. Some of the most useful are: """),
"",_(u"""  * name: the label of the control. """),
_(u"""  * role: one of the ROLE\\_\\* constants from NVDA's controlTypes module. Button, dialog, editableText, window and checkbox are examples of roles. """),
_(u"""  * states: a set of 0 or more of the STATE\\_\\* constants from NVDA's controlTypes module. Focusable, focused, selected, selectable, expanded, collapsed and checked are some examples of states. """),
_(u"""  * value: the value of the control; e.g. the percentage of a scroll bar or the current setting of a combo box. """),
_(u"""  * description: a sentence or two describing what the control does \\(usually the same as its tooltip\\). """),
_(u"""  * location: the object's left, top, width and height positions in screen coordinates. """),
_(u"""  * parent: this object's parent object. For example, a list item object's parent would be the list containing it. """),
_(u"""  * next: the object directly after this one on the same level in logical order. For example, a menu item NVDA Object's next object is most likely another menu item within the same menu. """),
_(u"""  * previous: like next but in reverse. """),
_(u"""  * firstChild: the first direct child object of this object. For example, a list's first child would be the first list item. """),
_(u"""  * lastChild: the last direct child of this object. """),
_(u"""  * children: a list of all the direct children of this object; e.g. all the menu items in a menu. """),
"","",_(u"""There are also a few simplified navigation properties such as simpleParent, simpleNext, simpleFirstChild and simpleLastChild. These are like their respective navigation properties described above, but NVDA filters out unuseful objects. These properties are used when NVDA's simple review mode is turned on, which is the default. These simple properties may be easier to use, but the real navigation properties more closely reflect the underlying Operating System structure. Also, these may change in future versions of NVDA as improvements are made to simple review, so they should generally be avoided when programmatically locating specific objects. """),
"",_(u"""When developing plugins, most of the time, it is not important what toolkit or API backs an NVDA Object, as the plugin will usually only access standard properties such as name, role and value. However, as plugins become more advanced, it is certainly possible to delve deeper into NVDA Objects to find out toolkit or API specific information if required. """),
"",_(u"""Plugins make use of NVDA Objects in three particular ways: """),
"",_(u"""  * Most events that plugins receive take an argument which is the NVDA Object on which the event occurred. For example, event\\_gainFocus takes the NVDA Object that represents the control gaining focus. """),
_(u"""  * Scripts, events or other code may fetch objects of interest such as the NVDA Object with focus, NVDA's current navigator object, or perhaps the Desktop NVDA Object. The code may then retreave information from that object or perhaps even retreave another object related to it \\(e.g. its parent, first child, etc.\\). """),
_(u"""  * the Plugin may define its own custom NVDA Object classes which will be used to wrap a specific control to give it extra functionality, mutate its properties, etc. """),
"","",_(u"""Just like App Modules and Global Plugins, NVDA Objects can also define events, scripts and gesture bindings. """),
"",_(u"""### 3.10. Scripts and Gesture Bindings"""),
"",_(u"""App Modules, Global Plugins and NVDA Objects can define special methods which can be bound to a particular piece of input such as a key press. NVDA refers to these methods as scripts. """),
"",_(u"""A script is a standard Python instance method with a name starting with \"script\\_\"; e.g. \"script\\_sayDateTime\". """),
"",_(u"""A script method takes two arguments: """),
"",_(u"""  * self: a reference to the App Module, Global Plugin or NVDA Object instance the script was called on. """),
_(u"""  * gesture: an Input Gesture object, which represents the input that caused the script to run. """),
"","",_(u"""As well as the actual script method, some form of gesture binding must be defined, so that NVDA knows what input should execute the script. """),
"",_(u"""A gesture identifier string is a simple string representation of a piece of input. It consists of a two letter character code denoting the source of the input, an optional device in brackets, a colon \\(:\\) and one or more names separated by a plus \\(+\\) denoting the actual keys or input values. """),
"",_(u"""Some examples of gesture string identifiers are: """),
